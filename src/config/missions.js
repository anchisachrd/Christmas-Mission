    question:
      "If we had a perfect cozy Christmas date, what would it look like?",
    rewardText: "I imagine starting the day cooking together, like making Christmas-themed cookies or even a mini Christmas pizza, and definitely making hot chocolate bombs for the night because that’s a must for me. Then we could go visit family, yours or mine, and later walk around a Christmas market to see the lights and the tree. After that, we’d come back home, make some fondue, warm milk, drop the chocolate bombs in, pick a Christmas movie we’ve never watched before, and end the night exchanging gifts beside the Christmas tree we decorated together earlier in the day.",

    question:
      "What do you wish I could understand better about you? (It can be about anything)",
    rewardText:
      "I wish you could understand that I’m still learning how to express my feelings clearly. Sometimes I feel a lot more than I’m able to say. I know I’m afraid to express my true feelings because my background has shaped me to be this way. It’s not only when I feel bad sometimes even when I feel love, I act cool because I don’t know how to express it verbally. Most of the time, I show it through my actions instead. But I’m willing to keep learning, especially with you. I’ve also never been in a long-distance relationship this serious before, which is why I need reassurance sometimes to feel that I still matter, that I’m seen, and that my presence isn’t taken for granted just because I’m always here",

    rewardText:
      "I’d make ribs as the main dish, along with some veggies I once cooked for you because I love them, and I’m pretty sure my recipe will be unforgettable😋One of the ribs does have to be spicy though, sorry about that, baby. I’d also cook some jasmine rice to go with the ribs. For drinks, just water. No soda, please🙄And for dessert, I’d make dark chocolate brownies, because that’s the only serious dessert I actually know how to make and we have to eat them with Ben and Jerry's ice cream!",

    rewardTitle: "My Turn: The Moment \nThat You Made Me Flutter",
    rewardText:
      "I remember when we were walking the trail together in Red River and stopped to sit on the ground. You asked me about making it official, but honestly, that wasn’t the moment that made me blush or feel butterflies. It was later, after my boss called me to come back early and we had to go down the mountain. You helped me get up by holding both of my arms and pulling me up. It might sound strange, but I hadn’t experienced that in a very long time. People usually just offer a hand for me to grab, but you actually held me and pulled me up yourself. I probably looked like I didn’t feel anything at the time because I was trying so hard to hide it, but the truth is I was really fluttering inside. So I’ll admit that unexpected physical touch makes my cool act disappear sometimes. And when you randomly stare at me that works too",

    rewardText: "This isn’t anything serious, but there are so many moments when I catch myself thinking, when I look at you, damn… is this really my boyfriend? Especially when you shave your beard, long hair, and don’t wear a hat. And then you just smile and look at me. I’m not sure if you notice it or not, but I get really shy. I don’t say much because I’m just blushing, so I stay quiet and try to act coo even though I’m really bad at it",

    question: "What did you first think of me  \nand how has it changed ?",
    rewardText: "For the non-serious part, I used to think you were a non-native who lived in the US because of the way you text sometimes. I didn’t always understand what you were trying to say, and there were moments when I had to use AI to grammar-check your messages hahaha. But now I know it’s just because you’re old and low-tech. For the serious part, I used to think you were a love-bomber. I even asked people around me whether your behavior seemed like love-bombing or if you were just pretending because you wanted something from me. I thought that once I left Red River, everything that happened between us would be temporary. I wasn’t sure if you were actually serious about me, especially because long distance is so hard. Please don’t feel frustrated or bad about that. Back then, we had only known each other for a very short time. But you proved me wrong. When you texted me while I was in Las Vegas because you felt unsure about us and about my feelings since I hadn’t made things clear and didn’t text or update you the whole day, I realized how much you cared. I know I handled that really badly. Then I called you so we could clear things up, and from that moment, something inside me shifted. It felt like a part of my feelings finally unlocked. You showed me that there are still people who don’t play games and who are genuinely honest about how they feel. The effort you’ve put into me is priceless. Even now, I still feel your affection, even when I don’t have anything interesting to share like I did when I was in the US. Everything between us might have seemed exaggerated at first, but you won me over. Love you.",
